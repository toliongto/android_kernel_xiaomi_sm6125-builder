# Background
The naming, Perf Neon, is inspired by a Linux Distribution called KDE Neon, where KDE take latest Ubuntu LTS as a base system and then put Latest KDE on top of it. Same thing as Perf Neon, where i take whatever the world the LineageOS team put under [LineageOS/android_kernel_xiaomi_sm6125](https://github.com/LineageOS/android_kernel_xiaomi_sm6125) and then put minimal patches on top of it.

# What is it for?
While it's mostly used for another kernel developers to compare their work with a literal close-to-stock kernel, it's also fulfill the dream of a purists, where they want everything stable but also wanted extra spices on top of it.

# Release schedules
This kernel follows weekly builds of LineageOS, you will get a new kernel build every sunday. You might need to check out the GitHub repo for new releases.

# Compatibility
Compatible with official LineageOS builds of [devices/ginkgo/builds](https://download.lineageos.org/devices/ginkgo/builds), [devices/laurel_sprout/builds](https://download.lineageos.org/devices/laurel_sprout/builds), but since this kernel strictly follows [LineageOS/android_kernel_xiaomi_sm6125](https://github.com/LineageOS/android_kernel_xiaomi_sm6125), the compatibility may vary between each releases. Always make sure you have a kernel backup before proceeding. This kernel might gonna work on non-lineage based roms but it is not guaranteed.
